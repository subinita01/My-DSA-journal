DEFINITION:
An array is like an egg carton â€” a container that holds multiple items of the same kind, 
where each item is placed in a fixed slot (index), and you can access or modify any item by referring to its slot number.

KEY PROPERTIES: 
1. Fixed size: The size is defined at compile time (unless using dynamic allocation).
2. Zero-based indexing: First element is at index 0.
3. Same type: All elements must be of the same type.
4. Random access: You can directly access any element using its index in O(1) time.

BASIC SYNTAX:
int numbers[5];        // declares an array of 5 integers
int scores[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // declares and initializes

EXAMPLE:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[3] = {5, 10, 15};
    
    cout << arr[0] << endl;  // Output: 5
    cout << arr[1] << endl;  // Output: 10
    cout << arr[2] << endl;  // Output: 15

    return 0;
}
